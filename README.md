# Company Site Analytics Dashboard
Developed a dynamic, pixel-perfect analytics dashboard to visualize company/site performance using interactive charts, metrics, and world demographics.
Structured the project using modular architecture with well-organized folders (components, pages, db, utils) to enhance scalability and maintainability.

Implemented reusable and responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS and React functional components across complex modules like: CountryMetrics, Demographics, and Profile Overview
Integrated location-based data visualization for company branches using dotted-map and flags (flag-icons) to display global presence.

Utilized React Router v7 for seamless page navigation and TypeScript for robust type-checking and error handling. Leveraged Vite for fast build times and eslint for maintaining code quality.
